In english, abrstraction is the term to simmplify. For computer science terms, it means to isolate complex
thinking. Constructor means a type of thing in english terms. In computer science terms, it means to
assign a computer to do different tasks. The Function means to do premade tasks. In computer science, its
to commit to a collection of components that can be used to run functions. A variable means something
that does assigned instructions. In computer science its to fetch memory for the computer. Bolean's are
either true or false statements. In computer science its an expression that produces a value thats either true
or false.


Class:
Eng: A group of students
CS: A template that allows you to create a new type of object, it has fields and/or methods one of which is
the constructor

Constructor:
Eng: Something which builds something (maybe in construction)
CS: A special kind of method which runs when you create an object in a class (specifically meant to
create that type of object)
Public:
Eng: The general population or something that is open to the general population
CS: If something is public it means it can be accessed by another class
Replacement:
Eng: The process of switching something with something else
CS: The process representing a more complex thing with a name (ex Person steve = new Person("Steve"),
the name steve represents the more complex idea of a Person)
Object:
Eng: An item
CS: Something which has a type and can do various things. It is inherited from a class which provides a
template for what the object can do



A function is something that completes a task or an action. It's a group of code that can be called to
execute some kind of instruction (usually something that you repeat many times).
A parameter is something that you can put into a function that can modify the output of the function. A
parameter can be any type of variable.
Abstraction means to simplify something by hiding away the complicated stuff and only focusing on the
most important parts of it. Abstraction helps simplify stuff for higher-level users.
Booleans are something that can only be true or false. In Java, we use them to help define stuff that can
only be true or false, stuff like “does this exist”.
A class is a group of things. In Java, we use it as a blueprint that we can “copy and paste” many times by
creating many classes. Java uses OOP or object-oriented programming, meaning that everything is an
object and classes are a huge thing. Classes can also be thought of as just types.


1. Algorithm

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions used to solve a problem or complete a task.
An algorithm is a procedure or formula for solving a problem. It is often used to process data or perform calculations.



2. Network

A network is a group of connected people or things that can talk to each other or share resources.
A network is a collection of computers, servers, or devices connected to share data and resources. This happens often through the internet.



3. Bug

A bug is a small annoying insect.
A bug is an error or issue in code that causes a program to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly.



4. Cloud

A cloud is condensed water vapor floating in the sky.
The cloud is remote servers that store, manage, and process data instead of using a local computer.



5. Compiler

A compiler is someone or something that gathers and organizes information into one collection.
A compiler is a program that translates a programming language into machine language so the computer can run it.

=======================

Types: Use a class to use some type of things
Method: Perform a specific task or function
Constructor: Instruction for building something
Class: A grouping of things of the same type
Repository: Set of files organized by folders in github
Declare: Allocate memory to a variable and identify its type

I did ten on accident. My bad, My bad.

Class -

English: A set or category of things having some property or attribute in common and differentiated by other by kind, type, or quality.

CS: Defines the shared characteristics of an object, including their methods and fields.



Type -

English: A category of people or things having a common characteristic.

CS: A category of data telling the compiler how much memory to allocate and how to treat data.



Abstraction:

English: The idea of generalizing rules and concepts into one larger concept.

CS: The process of taking a complicated system, methods, or fields and hiding them away into one larger, cohesive thing.



Variable -

English: Something that is changing and not constant.

CS: A symbolic name given to some address or piece of memory in a computer that holds value.



Constant -

English: Something that is not changing.

CS: A variable that does not change through the lifetime of a program.



Public -

English: Concerning the people as a whole.

CS: Something that is accessible to us in all classes.



Private -

English: Belonging to only one group or individual for there use.

CS: Something that can only be used in the class that it was created it.



Constructor -

English: A person or company that builds, designs, or makes something.

CS: A subroutine designed to create an instance of an object in class.



Instance -

English: An example of a single occurrence of something.

CS: A concrete realization of class.
